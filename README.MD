# Notes App Plan

## Outline of UX
User opens the notes app and is given a blank screen with the option to create a new 
project. Once this is pressed, a form opens that allows them to name the project and add a description. 

Once they make the project, we take them to the projects page where they can add a todo. When they press that, they can add a title, description, due date, importance level, and any bullets.
There is then a completed button next to each bullet and an overall completed button. There should be an edit button and a delete button as well as a way to change the importance.

Each project should have a card on a main page.
