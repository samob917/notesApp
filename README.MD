# Notes App Plan

## Outline of UX
User opens the notes app and is given a blank screen with the option to create a new 
project. Once this is pressed, a form opens that allows them to name the project and add a description. 

Once they make the project, we take them to the projects page where they can add a todo. When they press that, they can add a title, description, due date, importance level, and any bullets.
There is then a completed button next to each bullet and an overall completed button. There should be an edit button and a delete button as well as a way to change the importance.

Each project should have a card on a main page.

---- Tech Details ----

Main page has header and footer. These stay constant so they are in the template. There is a main content div. This is where content is dynamically added.

The main display should have "Add to do" "Create new project" 

Considering having a list of projects on one side that you can scroll on then when you select one the main page changes and the new project and all its todos appear on the right main screen.
